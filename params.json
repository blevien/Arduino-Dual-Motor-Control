I am also not sure if it has proper flyback diode protection, but so far it doesn't seem to matter. The H-Bridge also gets hot, but not excessivly so.\r\n\r\nEventually, I may upgrade it to use a cheap BLE module but for now I am calling this done.\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n-------------------\r\nBasic Operation:\r\n* Power comes into the board through a 7805 Regulator. One rail is 5v for Arduino, the other is supply voltage for motors.\r\n* Arduino Digital Pins read pulses from RC reciever (Steering & Throttle Separately) and translates pulses for Direction & Speed into 0-5v (PWM) and a forward or backwards\r\n* Arduino sends 0-5v (PWM) to H-Bridge enable pin, and sets the proper configuration of the motor control lines to H-Bridge according to direction\r\n\r\n\r\nFinal Proto-Board\r\n------------------\r\n![alt tag](https://github.com/blevien/Arduino-Dual-Motor-Control/blob/master/Dual_Motor_Control-Final.jpg?raw=true)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
